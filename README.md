[FFmpeg Android Compiler](https://github.com/ervikaspec/ffmpeg_android_compiler/) is a complete project that simplifies your task of building ffmpeg using latest ffmpeg source code and Android NDK.

NDK r15b is already supplied with this compiler helper as newer versions of NDK were causing problems with C++ formats in ffmpeg source code.
